          It is also interesting to look at this in combination with the top
          activations for a specific word position. We can do that by checking
          the activation for each word in the vocabulary. Interestingly, often
          none of the tokens that have high weights in the linear combination of
          tokens to input into the model can be found in these top activating
          ones. This shows one possible problem with this method and supports
          our theory that sometimes the annealing process removes highly
          activating tokens from the set of tokens that can be selected by the
          dreaming process.
