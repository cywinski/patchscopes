          This explainable shows experiments aimed at looking into what a deep
          transformer language model, namely BERT, has learned. Although our
          attempts didn't work as well as we were hoping, we got some
          interesting insights into how a language model builds up its
          understanding of text using these methods. Thus, we are not giving up,
          and hope that one day we can understand what individual components of
          text models have learned through approaches like these. To support
          further research in this direction, we open-sourced all our{" "}
